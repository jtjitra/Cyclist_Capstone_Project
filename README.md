# Cyclist_Capstone_Project

In this project, I played as a Junior Data Analyst helping a Cyclist, a bike-share company, analyze its rider data to determine how to convert casual riders into members. In order to do this, I needed to understand how casual riders and member riders use Cyclist bikes differently. 

## Method 
The biker data was downloaded from an Amazon drive in .csv files. One .csv file contained one month of biker data so I downloaded all the data from January 2021 to January 2022. I later processed and prepared the data using R.
