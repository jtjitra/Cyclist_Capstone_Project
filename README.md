# Cyclist_Capstone_Project

In this project, I played as a Junior Data Analyst helping Cyclist, a bike-share company, analyze its rider data to determine how to convert casual riders into members. In order to do this, I needed to understand how casual riders and member riders use Cyclist bikes differently. 

## Method 
The biker data was downloaded from an Amazon drive in .csv files. One .csv file contained one month of biker data so I downloaded all the data from January 2021 to January 2022. All the files together amounted to 1062.9 MB or 1.0629 GB. Excel kept crashing whenever I tried to open the files so I decided to process and prepare the data using R since it can handle large amounts of data. If you'd like to view my R code, you can click the file labelled 'Cyclist_Capstone_Project.Rmd'.

# Analysis 
Here are the visuals I created for data insights using R.

This bar chart shows the number of rides per day of the week for each biker type: casual riders and member riders.
